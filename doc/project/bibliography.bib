	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important imaging modality in stroke. Computer based automated medical image processing is increasingly finding its way into clinical routine. The Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge is a continuous effort to develop and identify benchmark methods for acute and sub-acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation. Here we introduce an expert-annotated, multicenter MRI dataset for segmentation of acute to subacute stroke lesions ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7153326 ). This dataset comprises 400 multi-vendor MRI cases with high variability in stroke lesion size, quantity and location. It is split into a training dataset of n = 250 and a test dataset of n = 150. All training data is publicly available. The test dataset will be used for model validation only and will not be released to the public. This dataset serves as the foundation of the ISLES 2022 challenge ( https://www.isles-challenge.org/ ) with the goal of finding algorithmic methods to enable the development and benchmarking of automatic, robust and accurate segmentation methods for ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Abstract Brain extraction is a critical preprocessing step in the analysis of neuroimaging studies conducted with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and influences the accuracy of downstream analyses. The majority of brain extraction algorithms are, however, optimized for processing healthy brains and thus frequently fail in the presence of pathologically altered brain or when applied to heterogeneous MRI datasets. Here we introduce a new, rigorously validated algorithm (termed HD-BET) relying on artificial neural networks that aim to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that HD-BET outperforms six popular, publicly available brain extraction algorithms in several large-scale neuroimaging datasets, including one from a prospective multicentric trial in neuro-oncology, yielding state-of-the-art performance with median improvements of +1.16 to +2.50 points for the Dice coefficient and −0.66 to −2.51 mm for the Hausdorff distance. Importantly, the HD-BET algorithm, which shows robust performance in the presence of pathology or treatment-induced tissue alterations, is applicable to a broad range of MRI sequence types and is not influenced by variations in MRI hardware and acquisition parameters encountered in both research and clinical practice. For broader accessibility, the HD-BET prediction algorithm is made freely available (www.neuroAI-HD.org) and may become an essential component for robust, automated, high-throughput processing of MRI neuroimaging data.},

The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.",

The properties of the sequence of representation functions are characterized by an approach based on the concept of frames. Utilizing the piecewise Zak transform (PZT), the frame operator associated with the multiwindow Gabor-type frame is examined for a rational oversampling rate by representing the frame operator as a finite-order matrix-valued function in the PZT domain. Completeness and frame properties of the sequence of representation functions are examined in relation to the properties of the matrix-valued function. Calculations of the frame bounds and the dual frame, as well as the issue of tight frames, are considered. It is shown that the properties of the sequence of representation functions are essentially not changed by replacing the widely used exponential kernel with other kernels. Some examples and the issue of a different sampling rate for each window are also considered. The so-called Balian–Low theorem is generalized to consideration of a scheme of multiwindows which makes it possible to overcome in a way the constraint imposed by the original theorem in the case of a single window.}

T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans were acquired in each subject and further processed using a voxel-based approach that was optimized for the identification of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment. Analysis of covariance revealed a classical neuroanatomy sexual dimorphism, men exhibiting larger gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF compartment volumes, together with larger WM and CSF fractions, whereas women showed larger GM fraction. GM and WM were found to significantly decrease with age, while CSF volume significantly increased. Tissue probability map analysis showed that the highest rates of GM atrophy in this age range were localized in primary cortices, the angular and superior parietal gyri, the orbital part of the prefrontal cortex, and in the hippocampal region. There was no significant interaction between “Sex” and “Age” for any of the tissue volumes, as well as for any of the tissue probability maps. These findings indicate that brain atrophy during the seventh and eighth decades of life is ubiquitous and proceeds at a rate that is not modulated by “Sex”.}

	abstract = {Robust and reliable stroke lesion segmentation is a crucial step toward employing lesion volume as an independent endpoint for randomized trials. The aim of this work was to develop and evaluate a novel method to segment sub-acute ischemic stroke lesions from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. After preprocessing of the datasets, a Bayesian technique based on Gabor textures extracted from the FLAIR signal intensities is utilized to generate a first estimate of the lesion segmentation. Using this initial segmentation, a customized voxel-level Markov random field model based on intensity as well as Gabor texture features is employed to refine the stroke lesion segmentation. The proposed method was developed and evaluated based on 151 multi-center datasets from three different databases using a leave-one-patient-out validation approach. The comparison of the automatically segmented stroke lesions with manual ground truth segmentation revealed an average Dice coefficient of 0.582, which is in the upper range of previously presented lesion segmentation methods using multi-modal MRI datasets. Furthermore, the results obtained by the proposed technique are superior compared to the results obtained by two methods based on convolutional neural networks and three phase level-sets, respectively, which performed best in the ISLES 2015 challenge using multi-modal imaging datasets. The results of the quantitative evaluation suggest that the proposed method leads to robust lesion segmentation results using FLAIR MRI datasets only as a follow-up sequence.},

	abstract = {Abstract The gold standard for identifying stroke lesions is manual tracing, a method that is known to be observer dependent and time consuming, thus impractical for big data studies. We propose LINDA (Lesion Identification with Neighborhood Data Analysis), an automated segmentation algorithm capable of learning the relationship between existing manual segmentations and a single T1-weighted MRI. A dataset of 60 left hemispheric chronic stroke patients is used to build the method and test it with k-fold and leave-one-out procedures. With respect to manual tracings, predicted lesion maps showed a mean dice overlap of 0.696 ± 0.16, Hausdorff distance of 17.9 ± 9.8 mm, and average displacement of 2.54 ± 1.38 mm. The manual and predicted lesion volumes correlated at r = 0.961. An additional dataset of 45 patients was utilized to test LINDA with independent data, achieving high accuracy rates and confirming its cross-institutional applicability. To investigate the cost of moving from manual tracings to automated segmentation, we performed comparative lesion-to-symptom mapping (LSM) on five behavioral scores. Predicted and manual lesions produced similar neuro-cognitive maps, albeit with some discussed discrepancies. Of note, region-wise LSM was more robust to the prediction error than voxel-wise LSM. Our results show that, while several limitations exist, our current results compete with or exceed the state-of-the-art, producing consistent predictions, very low failure rates, and transferable knowledge between labs. This work also establishes a new viewpoint on evaluating automated methods not only with segmentation accuracy but also with brain–behavior relationships.

To date, this is generally thought to be most precise when done manually, which is, however, both time-consuming and potentially observer-dependent. Fully automated lesion demarcation methods have been developed to address these issues, but these are often not practicable in acute stroke research where for each patient only a single image modality is available and the available image modality differs over patients. In the current study, we evaluated a semi-automated lesion demarcation approach, the so-called Clusterize algorithm, in acute stroke patients scanned in a range of common image modalities. Our results suggest that, compared to the standard of manual lesion demarcation, the semi-automated Clusterize algorithm is capable of significantly speeding up lesion demarcation in the most commonly used image modalities, without loss of either lesion demarcation precision or lesion demarcation reproducibility. For the three investigated acute datasets (CT, DWI, T2FLAIR), containing a total of 44 patient images obtained in a regular clinical setting at patient admission, the reduction in processing time was on average 17.8 min per patient and this advantage increased with increasing lesion volume (up to 60 min per patient for the largest lesion volumes in our datasets). Additionally, our results suggest that performance of the Clusterize algorithm in a chronic dataset with 11 T1 images was comparable to its performance in the acute datasets. We thus advocate the use of the Clusterize algorithm, integrated into a simple, freely available SPM toolbox, for the precise, reliable and fast preparation of imaging data for lesion–behaviour mapping analyses.}

	abstract = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease, and its diagnosis, treatment, and study relies on non-invasive imaging. Algorithms for stroke lesion segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes are intensely researched, but the reported results are largely incomparable due to different datasets and evaluation schemes. We approached this urgent problem of comparability with the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2015 conference. In this paper we propose a common evaluation framework, describe the publicly available datasets, and present the results of the two sub-challenges: Sub-Acute Stroke Lesion Segmentation (SISS) and Stroke Perfusion Estimation (SPES). A total of 16 research groups participated with a wide range of state-of-the-art automatic segmentation algorithms. A thorough analysis of the obtained data enables a critical evaluation of the current state-of-the-art, recommendations for further developments, and the identification of remaining challenges. The segmentation of acute perfusion lesions addressed in SPES was found to be feasible. However, algorithms applied to sub-acute lesion segmentation in SISS still lack accuracy. Overall, no algorithmic characteristic of any method was found to perform superior to the others. Instead, the characteristics of stroke lesion appearances, their evolution, and the observed challenges should be studied in detail. The annotated ISLES image datasets continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system to serve as an ongoing benchmarking resource (www.isles-challenge.org).},

	abstract = {Accurate stroke lesion segmentation is a critical step in the neuroimaging processing pipeline to assess the relationship between post-stroke brain structure, function, and behavior. While many multimodal segmentation algorithms have been developed for acute stroke neuroimaging, few are effective with only a single T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical MRI. This is a critical gap because most stroke rehabilitation research relies on a single T1w MRI for defining the lesion. Although several attempts to automate the segmentation of chronic lesions on single-channel T1w MRI have been made, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated on a large dataset. Here, we performed an exhaustive review of the literature and identified one semi-and three fully automated approaches for segmentation of chronic stroke lesions using T1w MRI within the last ten years: Clusterize, Automated Lesion Identification, Gaussian naïve Bayes lesion detection, and LINDA. We evaluated each method on a large T1w stroke dataset (N=181) using visual and quantitative methods. LINDA was the most computationally expensive approach, but performed best across the three main evaluation metrics (median values: Dice Coefficient=0.50, Hausdorff’s Distance=36.34 mm, and Average Symmetric Surface Distance=4.97 mm), whereas the Gaussian Bayes method had the highest recall/least false positives (median=0.80). Segmentation accuracy in all automated methods were influenced by size (small: worst) and stroke territory (brainstem, cerebellum: worst) of the lesion. To facilitate reproducible science, we have made our analysis files publicly available online at . We hope these findings are informative to future development of T1w lesion segmentation algorithms.},

Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs. In order to incorporate both local and larger contextual information, we employ a dual pathway architecture that processes the input images at multiple scales simultaneously. For post-processing of the network’s soft segmentation, we use a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field which effectively removes false positives.
