	abstract = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease, and its diagnosis, treatment, and study relies on non-invasive imaging. Algorithms for stroke lesion segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes are intensely researched, but the reported results are largely incomparable due to different datasets and evaluation schemes. We approached this urgent problem of comparability with the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2015 conference. In this paper we propose a common evaluation framework, describe the publicly available datasets, and present the results of the two sub-challenges: Sub-Acute Stroke Lesion Segmentation (SISS) and Stroke Perfusion Estimation (SPES). A total of 16 research groups participated with a wide range of state-of-the-art automatic segmentation algorithms. A thorough analysis of the obtained data enables a critical evaluation of the current state-of-the-art, recommendations for further developments, and the identification of remaining challenges. The segmentation of acute perfusion lesions addressed in SPES was found to be feasible. However, algorithms applied to sub-acute lesion segmentation in SISS still lack accuracy. Overall, no algorithmic characteristic of any method was found to perform superior to the others. Instead, the characteristics of stroke lesion appearances, their evolution, and the observed challenges should be studied in detail. The annotated ISLES image datasets continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system to serve as an ongoing benchmarking resource (www.isles-challenge.org).},

	abstract = {Accurate stroke lesion segmentation is a critical step in the neuroimaging processing pipeline to assess the relationship between post-stroke brain structure, function, and behavior. While many multimodal segmentation algorithms have been developed for acute stroke neuroimaging, few are effective with only a single T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical MRI. This is a critical gap because most stroke rehabilitation research relies on a single T1w MRI for defining the lesion. Although several attempts to automate the segmentation of chronic lesions on single-channel T1w MRI have been made, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated on a large dataset. Here, we performed an exhaustive review of the literature and identified one semi-and three fully automated approaches for segmentation of chronic stroke lesions using T1w MRI within the last ten years: Clusterize, Automated Lesion Identification, Gaussian naïve Bayes lesion detection, and LINDA. We evaluated each method on a large T1w stroke dataset (N=181) using visual and quantitative methods. LINDA was the most computationally expensive approach, but performed best across the three main evaluation metrics (median values: Dice Coefficient=0.50, Hausdorff’s Distance=36.34 mm, and Average Symmetric Surface Distance=4.97 mm), whereas the Gaussian Bayes method had the highest recall/least false positives (median=0.80). Segmentation accuracy in all automated methods were influenced by size (small: worst) and stroke territory (brainstem, cerebellum: worst) of the lesion. To facilitate reproducible science, we have made our analysis files publicly available online at . We hope these findings are informative to future development of T1w lesion segmentation algorithms.},
