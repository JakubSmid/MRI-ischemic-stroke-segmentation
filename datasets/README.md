# Datasets
This folder contains three folders with unmodified datasets (Motol, SISS2015_Training and ISLES-2022) and with original data structure.

Also to the Motol dataset there has been added brain masks generated using HD-BET.

In this folder there are two executable scripts:
- `download_Motol.py` - which has been used to download Motol dataset from NAS drive
- `preprocessing_deepmedic.py` - which is script for preprocessing data for DeepMedic (contains brain extraction, co-registration, reshaping, data normalization, ...)
